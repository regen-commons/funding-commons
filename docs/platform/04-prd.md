# Product requirements: Regen Commons Weave (working name)

Status: draft for council review · Author: Afolabi Aiyeloja with Claude · Date: 2026-10-31
Companion documents: [proposal brief](01-proposal-brief.md) · [business model canvas](02-business-model-canvas.md) · [logical architecture](03-logical-architecture.md) · [technical spec](05-technical-spec.md) · [research digest](06-research-digest.md) · [agent scaffolding](07-agent-scaffolding.md) · [saving and accounts](08-accounts-and-saving.md) · [open decisions](open-decisions.md) · [design system](../../DESIGN.md)

Interface revision, 4 November 2026: places the [prototype review decisions](prototype/review-decisions.md) for Step 0 of the [implementation handover](handover/03-interface-implementation.md#step-0-place-the-decisions). The two visibility choices, partners for shared initiatives and one email door remain council proposals ([D26 to D28](open-decisions.md#for-the-council)). The technical specification and pattern guidance still need the follow-up changes tracked in the review decisions; this revision does not change a database or approve a service.

## 1. Summary

Funding Commons today is a browser-local directory of 699 funders and 768 programs with local-AI ranking against a project profile. This revamp turns it into a place where regenerative initiatives say who they are, what they need and what they can offer across eight forms of capital, and get matched to partners and to funding opportunities, both alone and in partnership. Curation is organised by bioregion and watershed and across five lenses: art and culture, research, technology, place-based community, and funders.

The product promise in one line: tell us about your work in three short conversations, and we will show you who to work with and what to apply for, together.

## 2. Problem

- Initiatives write the same proposals in parallel, compete for the same pools and rebuild partnerships from scratch each cycle. The September 2026 "Regen Partnerships & Funding Hub" Google Doc was built to fix this by hand; it has seven initiative rows, forty funders and eight partnership calls, and it is hard to navigate and keep fresh.
- Funders see financial need but not the material, intellectual, social, cultural, experiential, living and spiritual capital that place-based work already holds. Stewards raised this directly on the October council sync: many groups doing the most important work are hard for funders to read, because their work is diversified and they will not narrow it to chase a fund.
- Funding calls increasingly ask for cross-discipline teams (a place-based pilot, a research partner, a tooling provider, a cultural component). Nobody can see at a glance who would complete whom.
- Static lists get little uptake. A grants doc shared in mid-2026 drew no responses; live calls and a weekly pulse do better.
- Data entry is the enemy. Forms with twenty fields are abandoned, and scraped initiative data goes stale and annoys the people it describes.

## 3. Goals and non-goals

Goals

1. An initiative can be captured in under ten minutes on a phone, by talking, typing or dropping a deck or website link, in three steps: initiative, needs, offers.
2. Every need and offer carries forms of capital and place, so matching works on complementarity, not just keywords.
3. Each initiative sees ranked partners and ranked opportunities, with an explicit "stronger together" score and a suggested partner set for each opportunity.
4. Bioregion and watershed are first-class ways to browse, curate and receive a weekly pulse.
5. Local AI by default; cloud AI only with explicit, logged consent.
6. Every record is self-submitted, dated and easy to confirm or retire, so the directory stays trustworthy.
7. The platform feeds the Regen Commons membership funnel and is stewarded through the existing steward desk.
8. Records are portable and interoperable (open schemas, open identifiers), so the platform is one node among many rather than a silo.

Non-goals (for the first two phases)

- No on-chain transactions, wallets or token issuance. Commitment-pooling interoperability is designed for, not shipped, until Phase 3.
- No automated scraping of initiatives from other directories.
- No replacement for funders' own application portals; the platform points at official calls and keeps its "opportunity is not eligibility" stance.
- No public contact details. Introductions are relayed with consent.
- No single-issue taxonomy. Initiatives are described in their own words, with tags as an index, never as the identity.

## 4. Users and jobs to be done

| Who | Job to be done | Today | With the platform |
|---|---|---|---|
| Place-based initiative (community hub, restoration crew, agroecology coop) | Find money and partners for the next chapter without a grant writer | Word of mouth, Telegram, one-off calls | Three-step intake by voice, weekly pulse, partner suggestions, recipes to join |
| Technology or tooling builder (Green Goods, Gardens, Coop) | Find communities to pilot with and co-applicants for ecosystem grants | Cold outreach | Offers of tooling matched to needs for tooling; opportunity matches that need a tech partner |
| Researcher or academic (Metagov, universities, methodology groups) | Find place-based partners and funders that want a research component | Conference serendipity | Offers of research capacity matched to needs; research-flavoured opportunities |
| Artist, storyteller, culture bearer | Join regenerative work with cultural and spiritual capital; find funds that value it | Mostly invisible to funders | Culture lens in curation, culture-tagged offers and opportunities |
| Funder, allocator, round operator, bioregional financing facility | Find ready partnerships and understand regional needs | Inbound applications | Browse initiatives and needs by region and theme; publish calls; see what a region needs |
| Network stewards (Regen Commons council, Bloom, Greenpill, ReFi DAO, Regen Coordination) | Keep the commons tidy, run challenges, make the network legible to funders | Spreadsheets and docs | Steward desk views, regional curation, challenge cohorts, exports |

Personas are deliberately framed by lens rather than by organisation type, because curation and recipes use the same five lenses: art and culture, research, technology, place-based community, funders.

## 5. Core concepts and vocabulary

- Initiative: a project, organisation, collective or place-based effort. Four public fields: name, location(s), description, links. Everything else is derived and editable. It starts as a draft in the browser, becomes private when saved, and is shared only if its owner chooses. See [saving and accounts](08-accounts-and-saving.md).
- Need: something an initiative is looking for, with one or more forms of capital, a place scope, a timeframe and the exchange terms it would accept.
- Offer: something an initiative has in surplus and can give, exchange, sell or commit, with the same structure plus capacity.
- Forms of capital (from Roland and Landua, used by Regen Commons already): financial, material, living, social, intellectual, experiential, cultural, spiritual. A need or offer can carry several.
- Lenses: art and culture · research · technology · place-based community · funders. An initiative can carry several lenses; recipes use lenses as roles.
- Opportunity: a funder program or call from the existing Funding Commons catalog, with its researched eligibility, award, route and dates. Opportunity is never eligibility.
- Match: a scored, explained suggestion between an initiative and a partner, or an initiative and an opportunity. Opportunity matches show a solo score and a partnership score.
- Recipe: a partnership forming around an opportunity or a shared problem. It names the base (the opportunity or problem), the ingredients needed (lenses and forms of capital), who has joined, status (forming, drafting, submitted, funded, not this time) and a working doc. This is the Partnerships tab of the hub doc, made live.
- Place: a bioregion, subrealm, realm, watershed basin, country or a custom named place. Initiatives relate to places as based in, works in, or global.
- Pulse: the weekly email digest, personal to each initiative and region.
- Account: an email that can sign in. An account holds saved initiatives. It is not membership.
- Member: a Regen Commons member profile (existing data model). A person becomes a member only by choosing to apply.
- Steward: a council member with the existing steward role; stewards tidy, they do not filter.

## 6. Experience

Home has five parts: a short hero; three numbered steps, with the first starting the conversation; the eight kinds of support; recently shared initiatives; and funding closing soon, showing the three funds closing first with days left. The main navigation is Home, Partners, Funding and Initiatives. Partners and Funding are separate pages, never tabs. See [DL-024](../../packages/design-system/decision-log.md#dl-024-one-filter-bar-and-separate-list-pages).

### 6.1 Principles

Fun, simple, intuitive. Conversation over forms, led by voice: one short question at a time, a large Speak button first, typing below, and files or links available throughout. People can change their words afterwards. Show value before asking for anything. Mobile first. Progress saved locally so nothing is lost. The card fills in beside the conversation; Build my card reads the collected words on the device and works out the details, themes and structure. Everything the AI derives is shown in pencil for confirmation, never silently applied. Plain language in the Regen Commons voice: warm, second person, no jargon, with botanical language kept to places where nothing depends on it.

All interface work follows [DESIGN.md](../../DESIGN.md) and the three books it applies: *Don't Make Me Think* for how people use it, *Refactoring UI* for how screens show what matters, and *Atomic Design* for how the system stays whole. Labels use the plain names in [VOICE.md](../../packages/design-system/brand/VOICE.md). Domain terms in this document, such as recipe, pulse and lens, are not necessarily what people read.

### 6.2 The three-step conversation

The guide is called Assistant until its name is tested. Each step has a goal, short questions and a card beside the conversation. Speak comes first when local speech is available; typing, files and links remain alternatives. The transcript stays editable, and unavailable voice or model capabilities never block the task. See [DL-022](../../packages/design-system/decision-log.md#dl-022-describing-is-a-conversation-led-by-voice).

Step 1, Your initiative. Prompt: "Tell me about your work the way you would to a friend outside the movement." Inputs: free text, voice (transcribed locally), a website or social link (fetched server-side and summarised when that service exists), an uploaded deck or PDF (parsed locally). The card fills in beside the conversation. Build my card reads all the collected input on the device, then opens Check your card. Its four public fields are name, location(s) (free text; "global" allowed; multiple places allowed), description (two to four sentences in the initiative's own words, lightly edited), and links. Nothing else is required. Stage (seed, sprout, flowering, tree), lenses, themes (aligned with the funder catalog's theme vocabulary), beneficiaries and languages are derived and shown in pencil so they can be confirmed or corrected. Bioregion, watershed and country are also derived proposals; the boundary with typed locations and the optional pin or place search in R4 remains [D33](open-decisions.md#for-the-builders). Scale is removed because it repeats place and stage and cannot be corrected meaningfully. Eligibility details (legal form, registration country, applicant type, funding instruments preferred) are derived where possible and can be added later from Funding; they are never asked during intake.

Step 2, Your needs. Prompt: "What would unlock the next chapter?" Guidance text and examples: money with an amount and purpose; a co-applicant with a specific profile; an introduction; land access; a template; a reviewer; volunteers; equipment; a fiscal host. The guide listens and drafts need cards beside the conversation, each with Keep, Change and Remove. There are at most five needs, with a counter such as "3 of 5"; when more are heard, show the first five and say so. Each card: title, one-line description, every applicable form of capital shown alike, amount and currency (financial only), timeframe and urgency, place scope (here, our region, anywhere), exchange terms acceptable (gift, exchange, paid, commitment, open), what you would do with it. The form asks for all kinds that apply. The guide nudges once: "Money is one kind of support. What else would help?"

Step 3, Your offers. Prompt: "What do you have in surplus?" Guidance by form of capital: a track record with a funder (social), a methodology (intellectual), land or a venue (living, material), a workshop you run (experiential), a story or art practice (cultural), a ceremony or practice of care (spiritual), a tool or dataset (intellectual, material). Offer cards appear beside the same conversation with Keep, Change and Remove, a counter, and the same five-card limit and overflow notice as needs. Each offer card: title, description, every applicable form of capital shown alike, capacity (how much, how often), place scope, terms (gift, exchange, paid, commitment), who it is for. No kind is treated as primary. See [DL-023](../../packages/design-system/decision-log.md#dl-023-needs-and-offers-carry-every-applicable-kind-five-of-each-at-most).

Finish. First funding, the share card and "your card" appear together. The share card explains the partner-match count and what sharing opens, and holds the email field and code step where the reason is. Saving keeps a private copy; sharing is a separate confirmation. The two choices are "Private, for finding funding" (the default) and "Shared with the community" (a public page and directory entry). Sharing onward to open networks such as Murmurations and the knowledge commons remains separate and off by default. A draft never requires an email and lives in the browser until saved. See [saving and accounts](08-accounts-and-saving.md) and the council proposals D26 to D28.

Each step must be completable by voice only, by typing only, and by upload only. Each step must work with no AI at all (plain fields with sensible defaults) so the product never blocks on a model download.

### 6.3 What the user sees after finishing

- Partners: a separate page. Before sharing, a share card shows the partner-match count and how to share, with no partner names, individual cards or veiled previews. After sharing, partner cards show why (a need you have that they offer, an offer you have that they need, shared place, shared theme, complementary lens) and a strength band. Names, cards and introductions depend on sharing, not saving or signing in. A private initiative never becomes a candidate in someone else's matches. Anyone can still browse public initiatives. See [DL-019](../../packages/design-system/decision-log.md#dl-019-partners-are-for-shared-initiatives).
- Funding: a separate page using the existing catalog and solo rubric, with fit, readiness and reasons. Opportunity detail has team slots: each fund's partner requirement shows candidates to pick; a team fit explains what the picks cover; one action requests introductions to the selected partners, with the R43 confirmation. A funding card says how many asks the list could cover. Private initiatives see counts only in team slots, never candidate names. Structured fund asks and scoring beyond the current two-partner limit need the technical follow-up in [D29](open-decisions.md#for-the-builders); use labelled fixtures for asks until then. Visitor Funding uses the whole catalog, unranked, with a prompt to describe an initiative as the labelled prototype default, pending D34.
- Initiatives: a public directory with search, filters and sort, plus a public initiative page with media, need and offer cards and link previews. The Support filter searches offers, needs or both. Partners also offers "Offers what you need" and "Needs what you offer" once a person has an initiative. Navigation wording remains a usability question in T9.
- Recipes: open a recipe from an opportunity or a problem; name the ingredients needed; others join with what they bring; a working doc link; status. Recipes are visible to members by default and optionally public.
- Places: a bioregion or watershed page lists initiatives, open needs, offers, opportunities with regional scope, and recipes forming. Later it carries a synthesised "needs of this place" summary built from consented records.
- The live Funding Commons catalog stays working while the app's Funding page is built; its matching panel will use the person's initiative instead of a local project profile.
- Pulse: a weekly email per initiative: new partners, opportunities closing within three weeks in your themes and places, needs in your watershed you could meet, recipes that need your ingredient, and a one-tap "still accurate" link that refreshes the record's confirmed date.

### 6.4 Steward experience

New sections in the existing steward desk: Initiatives (list, detail, verify, merge duplicates, hide with reason, revision history), Needs and offers (flag, hide), Opportunities (the existing Monday discovery and Thursday freshness workflow stays in the repository; the desk shows the catalog state and lets stewards pin regional or thematic highlights), Recipes (support, close), Matching (quality feedback counts, dismissed reasons, weights preview), Pulse (preview, pause, regional pulses), Challenges (create a time-boxed cohort; track groups formed). Steward actions keep the existing pattern: revision checks, mandatory private reasons, audit events, idempotent commands.

### 6.5 Accessibility and devices

Mobile first, with the full three-step flow usable at 360 px wide. Keyboard and screen-reader paths for every action. All animation respects reduced motion. Voice is optional and never the only route. Model downloads are explicit, show their size first and can be cancelled. Supported targets: current Chrome and Edge on desktop and Android, Safari 26 on iOS and macOS, Firefox desktop. Minimum-capability devices get keyword matching and plain forms with no degradation of core tasks.

## 7. Functional requirements

Requirement identifiers are stable so the technical spec and tests can reference them.

Intake and records

- R1 Three-step intake with voice, text, link and file input; each step independently savable; drafts stored locally without sign-in.
- R2 The four public initiative fields are the only ones asked for. Stage, lenses, themes, beneficiaries, languages and eligibility details are derived from the description, locations and links, and shown in pencil for confirmation or correction. Scale is not a separate field.
- R3 At most five needs and five offers per initiative, with a counter and an explicit notice if extraction hears more. Each card has Keep, Change and Remove; every applicable form of capital (multi-select of all eight, shown alike), place scope, timeframe or capacity, exchange terms and status (open, met, withdrawn, expired).
- R4 Location capture that accepts free text, "global", multiple places, and an optional pin or place search; the system attaches bioregion, subrealm, realm, watershed basin and country, shown as removable chips.
- R5 Editing after saving with revision history; records show last confirmed date; records unconfirmed for 180 days are marked "may be out of date" and excluded from pulse suggestions until confirmed.
- R6 Import of the September 2026 hub doc rows and the existing local project profiles as unconfirmed records for their owners to claim. Imported records show in pencil until claimed.

AI assistance

- R7 Local transcription of voice notes; multilingual by default; audio never leaves the device unless the user opts into cloud transcription.
- R8 Local extraction of the initiative draft, need cards and offer cards from text, transcript or parsed documents, constrained to the platform's schemas; every derived field is shown so it can be corrected, without asking extra questions.
- R9 Capability detection that chooses a local tier (browser model, desktop WebGPU model, mobile WebGPU model, WASM keyword mode) and shows the active tier and download size for this device. Offer optional downloads as "Keep your words on this device"; nothing downloads without a tap, downloads can resume and be removed in Settings, and the keyword draft works meanwhile. Models, exact sizes and storage behaviour remain subject to D32 and the technical specification owner's validation; the prototype sizes are proposals.
- R10 Consented cloud fallback for extraction and transcription: default off; consent per session or per field; the dialog names provider, model, region, retention and exactly what is sent; a consent and call ledger the user can view and export.
- R11 Heuristic (no-model) fallback that still produces valid cards from keywords and simple rules.

Matching

- R12 Partner matching that scores complementarity (my needs against their offers), reciprocity (their needs against my offers), place affinity, theme overlap and lens complementarity, with a plain-language reason for each suggestion.
- R13 Opportunity matching that reuses the existing thematic-fit, readiness and research-priority engine for the solo score.
- R14 Partnership scoring through team slots: for each strong-but-gated opportunity, show its partner requirements, candidates per requirement, a team fit and reasons, and one action requesting introductions to the selected partners after confirmation. Support several partners where the fund has several asks, replacing the fixed one-or-two-partner presentation. Funding cards summarise how many asks the list could cover. Private initiatives see counts, never candidate names. The source of structured asks and the scoring contract remain D29; fit is never eligibility.
- R15 Feedback loop: save, dismiss with reason, and introduction outcomes are recorded and used to tune weights; exposure caps keep any one initiative or funder from dominating pulses.
- R16 Opportunity matching runs for drafts in the browser before an email is requested. Partners shows a share card with a real partner-match count and how to share; it replaces the teaser and veiled cards. Partner names, cards, individual reasons and introductions open only for shared initiatives (give to get). Drafts and private initiatives see counts only, including in team slots, and never appear in anyone else's matches. Saving alone does not open partner cards.

Places and curation

- R17 Reference places: bioregions, subrealms, realms (One Earth or ecoregion equivalent), watershed basins (HydroBASINS levels 5 to 7), countries, and steward-defined custom places (a valley, a city region, an island).
- R18 Place pages with initiatives, needs, offers, opportunities, recipes and later a synthesised needs-of-the-place summary with sources.
- R19 Five-lens curation on every list; recipes name lenses as roles.
- R20 Steward highlights: pinned opportunities and recipes per place and lens, with an expiry.

Recipes and introductions

- R21 Recipes with base (opportunity or problem), ingredients (lenses, forms of capital, specific asks), lead, joiners, status, deadline and working doc; join and leave; stewards can close.
- R22 Introduction relay: "say hello" sends a message through the platform; contact details are shared only when both sides accept.

Pulse and notifications

- R23 Opt-in weekly pulse per saved initiative, off by default, with new partners, closing opportunities, regional needs, recipes needing an ingredient, and the "still accurate" confirmation; unsubscribe and frequency controls; regional pulses for stewards and funders who opt in.
- R24 Transactional emails: sign-in code, a first saved-card email, explicitly requested single-fund reminders, introduction requests and acceptances, recipe updates, steward notices. Remind me enables only the chosen reminder through the same email door as saving; a signed-in person is not asked for their email again. Weekly updates remain a separate, default-off opt-in under R23.

Accounts, membership and access

- R25 Email plus one-time code sign-in using the shared Regen Commons Supabase Auth project; no passwords; no third-party sign-in; asks for an email and nothing else.
- R26 A platform profile per account, linked to a Regen Commons member profile only when one exists; a separate "apply for membership" path that pre-fills the six-step application from the initiative, offered in context and never straight after saving.
- R27 Two visibility choices, subject to council confirmation in D26: "Private, for finding funding" (`private`, the default) and "Shared with the community" (`public`, a public page and directory entry). No signed-in-only middle level. Sharing onward to open directory networks and the knowledge commons is separate and off by default. Moving back to private or withdrawing sharing stops future distribution and emits a retraction event to connected networks. Stewards cannot read private initiatives. The treatment of open introductions when returning to private remains D31.
- R28 Access tiers configurable by stewards: open (anyone can browse, save and share), members-first (saving open, matches and pulse for members and people who have applied), members-only (whole platform behind membership). Phase 0 and 1 run open; the council can tighten later without a code change.

Interoperability and knowledge

- R29 Public records exportable as JSON, CSV and as profiles in the Murmurations organisations and offers-and-wants schemas; the platform publishes consented public profiles to the Murmurations index.
- R30 Every public record has a stable reference identifier (an ORN in a `regencommons` namespace) and a content hash, and the platform can act as a KOI partial node that publishes new, update and forget events for consented records.
- R31 Export of candidate knowledge objects (initiatives as organisations, places, funding mechanisms, recipes outcomes as case studies) in the Regen Knowledge Commons base shape, for review, never direct publication.
- R32 Offers can be marked as offerings with the fields a commitment-pool voucher needs (unit, capacity, place, timing, restrictions, terms), and accepted exchanges can be recorded as commitments (proposed, accepted, fulfilled, discharged) off-chain, so a later pool integration needs no data migration.

Stewardship and operations

- R33 Steward desk sections listed in 6.4, built on the existing revision, reason and audit pattern.
- R34 Funder catalog pipeline unchanged in substance: Monday discovery and Thursday freshness produce reviewed pull requests; the platform imports the published catalog on deploy and on a schedule.
- R35 Metrics for stewards and funders: initiatives shared, needs met, introductions accepted, recipes submitted and funded, pulse engagement, regional coverage; shown as counts with definitions, never as vanity dashboards.

Saving and accounts

- R36 Saving is separate from sharing: an email and a code store a private copy, with no name, password or other field requested. Save, share, remind and introduce use one email door; confirming the code saves the current initiative to that email before resuming the action. Sharing or sending an introduction still needs its own confirmation.
- R37 Browsing, search, the full conversation, local AI, opportunity matches and the partner-match count for a draft, copying your own draft, help and privacy information never require an email. Partner cards depend on sharing under R16, not on an email alone.
- R38 Unprompted saving is inline, offered once per seam and tied to its benefit; Not now stays declined. Finish and Partners before sharing put the email field and code step in the share card. Small tasks explicitly opened by the person (sign in, save, share or delete) and data information open over the current page as a dialog on wide screens or a bottom sheet on phones. Never interrupt arrival, recording or editing with an unsolicited dialog; no wall or pre-checked box. This refines DL-018 through DL-021 and DL-027.
- R39 The code step accepts paste, keeps what was typed on error, allows fixing a wrong email and resending after 60 seconds, survives a round trip to the mail app, and then resumes the action that asked for it.
- R40 Signing in merges local drafts without overwriting or duplicating. One email can hold several initiatives.
- R41 A status line always says where the work lives: on this device, or saved.
- R42 People can export everything and delete their account, which deletes private initiatives and retracts anything shared.
- R43 Introductions open once the initiative is shared (give to get); an introduction then shows the full card to one recipient after confirmation, without changing its visibility.

Design quality

- R44 Every screen is built from the design system: tokens from [DESIGN.md](../../DESIGN.md), patterns from the [inventory](../../packages/design-system/COMPONENTS.md), words from [VOICE.md](../../packages/design-system/brand/VOICE.md).
- R45 Every UI change passes the [five-minute review](../../DESIGN.md#how-we-follow-them). New screens pass the [checklist](../../packages/design-system/principles/ui-review-checklist.md).
- R46 Anything the assistant derives shows in pencil until a person confirms or corrects it; derived details never block the flow.
- R47 One usability round with real users runs before 30 November; the regular testing rhythm is set after launch. Fixes follow the [testing plan](../../packages/design-system/principles/usability-testing.md).

## 8. Quality requirements

- Privacy: drafts stay in the browser until the person saves; saved initiatives are private until the person shares them; embeddings of saved text may be stored server-side; audio and files never leave the device without explicit consent; cloud AI calls store hashes and derived fields, not raw prompts; the user can view and export their consent and AI-call ledger; retraction propagates to connected networks.
- Performance: first meaningful paint under 2 s on a mid-range Android over 4G; the directory and matching work before any model download; local extraction returns a draft within 20 s on a desktop WebGPU tier and within 60 s on the mobile tier, with the keyword fallback instant.
- Reliability: no data loss on tab close or network drop; idempotent writes; email delivery failures never lose the underlying record.
- Security: row-level security on every table; stewards authorised by the existing active-steward predicate; no service-role key in the browser; origin checks on write endpoints; rate limits on sign-in and intake; content security policy on the app shell.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA for the intake, matches, recipes and places pages; reduced-motion honoured by all animation including canvases; text survives 200 percent zoom and the largest browser text size.
- Design system: tests fail on stale tokens, contrast below AA in either theme, raw values in CSS, undocumented patterns and copy that breaks the voice rules.
- Internationalisation: UI strings externalised from the start; transcription multilingual; Portuguese and Spanish UI by the end of Phase 1 (Brazil and Latin America are active regions in the network).
- Openness: source code under an open licence agreed with the council (AGPL-3.0 keeps the option of reusing Coop code; see the technical spec); public data under an open data licence with attribution; schemas published.

## 9. Scope by phase

Phase names follow the Regen Commons stages of growth. Dates assume a full-time lead builder in November (afo, working with coding agents), then half to one full-time equivalent, plus steward time from the council; they are targets, not promises.

Phase 0, Seed: the first version (November 2026, live by 30 November): agent scaffolding first ([plan](07-agent-scaffolding.md)); the design system, in React on top of the CSS already defined, so the product carries Regen Commons branding and identity from day one; three-step intake with voice, file and typed input, local AI extraction in the browser and consented cloud fallback; the four public fields with everything else derived; needs and offers with forms of capital; public initiative directory; partner cards with reasons after sharing and a count-only share card before; opportunities with team slots; saving with an email code, private by default; import of the hub doc rows; one usability round; an early demo at the Community Spotlight on 5 November; evidence of working local AI with real users for the Mozilla Human-Scale AI application due 20 November.

Single-fund reminders use the email door in the Phase 0 proposal, subject to D28. Weekly updates remain Phase 1. The interface handover builds service-dependent screens against typed fixture adapters; sign-in, email, cloud AI, introductions and data-control services need their own owners and approvals before their entry points appear in production. A fixture screen does not establish a working service or change the later service phases.

Phase 1, Sprout (December 2026 to February 2027): partnership scoring refinements; weekly pulse; steward desk sections; place assignment (bioregion, watershed) and place pages; Murmurations publishing; open data export; Portuguese and Spanish UI.

Phase 2, Flowering (March to May 2027): recipes with join flows and introductions relay; challenge cohorts; regional pulses for funders and stewards; knowledge commons export and KOI partial node; member-first access tier; needs-of-the-place synthesis with sources; funder accounts for publishing calls; matching feedback loop.

Phase 3, Tree (from June 2027): offerings and commitments ledger; optional anchoring to Cosmo-Local Credit pools for a pilot bioregion; cross-pool coordination with partner networks; federation (other networks run the open-source app and exchange via KOI and Murmurations); governance of shared data under council policy.

## 10. Success measures

Measured monthly from Phase 1; targets for end of Phase 2.

- Shared initiatives: 150, across at least 12 bioregions and all five lenses.
- Saving: time from tapping save to saved on a phone under 90 seconds; people return after choosing Not now. Report the share of finished conversations that save, without a target until usability rounds give a baseline.
- Needs and offers per initiative: median 3 needs and 2 offers, at least 60 percent carrying a non-financial form of capital.
- Introductions accepted: 40 percent of requests; at least 50 accepted introductions.
- Recipes: 20 opened, 8 submitted, 3 funded or otherwise resourced.
- Pulse: 35 percent weekly open rate; 70 percent of records confirmed within 90 days.
- Local AI share: at least 80 percent of extractions and transcriptions run locally.
- Membership: count how many accounts choose to apply. No target, because a target invites pressure on people who came for something else.
- Stewardship: median time from sharing to steward review under 7 days; no record older than 180 days without a confirmation prompt.

## 11. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Builder bandwidth is thin and the plan is wide | Phase 0 is one month with the full core scope and a full-time lead working with coding agents; the order of cuts is agreed in advance if November slips; every later feature ships behind a flag; the funder catalog pipeline is already automated |
| Local models are too heavy for phones | Tiering with a 570 MB mobile model, keyword fallback, and consented cloud; download size shown before fetching; home-screen install encouraged on iOS |
| Stale records | Confirmation prompts in the pulse, visible confirmed dates, exclusion from suggestions after 180 days |
| Matching feels arbitrary | Every suggestion explains itself; dismiss reasons feed weights; stewards can inspect weights and feedback |
| A new silo | Open schemas, Murmurations publishing, KOI events, export anytime, link out to existing offers-and-needs activity |
| Taxonomy flattens diverse work | Free text first, tags as index, multiple lenses, no primary category |
| Cloud AI undermines the sovereignty story | Default off, per-use consent, named provider and retention, hashes not prompts, self-hosted community inference option in Phase 2 |
| Organisational ambiguity between Regen Commons and Regen Coordination | Housed under Regen Commons as a resource open to all networks; branded as such; partner networks are member organisations |
| Shared Supabase project migration drift | One migration owner (decided in the technical spec); schema namespaced; CI applies all migrations from a clean database |

## 12. Open decisions for the council

The current list, with owners and recommendations, is in [open decisions](open-decisions.md). The original questions were:

1. Name and subdomain (recommendation and alternatives in the proposal brief).
2. Access tier at launch: open, with members-first considered for Phase 2.
3. Source licence: AGPL-3.0 (recommended if Coop code is reused) or Apache-2.0 (maximum reuse by partner networks).
4. Data licence for public records: CC BY 4.0 recommended; CC BY-SA considered.
5. Which networks are first sharing targets: Murmurations index (yes), Regen KOI node run by Gaia AI (confirm), Hylo (link only), Bloom's offers-and-needs sessions (import with consent).
6. The pilot bioregions for Phase 2 place synthesis and the Phase 3 pool pilot: candidates from existing nodes include the San Francisco Bay and Central Valley watersheds (Bloom, Regen Commons roots), Nigeria's Lagos lagoon and Niger delta regions (Tech and Sun), southern Brazil (Regen Coordination stewards), and a Central American watershed (Bloom Costa Rica ties).
